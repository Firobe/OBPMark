\section{Benchmark \#5: Machine Learning Inference}
The "Machine Learning Inference" benchmark includes processing tasks that have been identified for use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) on-board spacecraft.

Note: Training of machine learning parameters (e.g. for neural networks) is not expected to be made on-board, and is hence not included in this benchmark set.

\subsection{Benchmark \#5.1: Object Detection}
TBA.

\subsection{Benchmark \#5.2: Cloud Screening}
TBA.
