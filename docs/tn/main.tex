\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Document Scope}
This document is intended to define a set of representative application cases to measure and compare the computing performance of embedded processing systems for the use in on-board space applications. The benchmarks are designed to be openly available and to encourage implementations by 3rd parties.
\\ \\
Users may select to implement the entire set of benchmarks or only a subset of select benchmarks, depending on the target applications of the system/device under test.
\\ \\
The provision to report and share benchmark results is also defined.
\\ \\
This document may also be provided as a reference or made applicable, as a whole or in parts, to ESA development contracts for evaluation of on-board data processing hardware.
